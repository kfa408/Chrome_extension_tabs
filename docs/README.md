# Chrome extension to organize tabs

This extension is intended to help people organize their tabs. I often have a large amount of tabs opened for reference for a specific task.  Some of those important references will be bookmarked. However, often times most references are only useful for the duration of the task, and not important enough to clutter up your bookmarks. This extension is to store those reference tabs for the duration that you needed, allowing people to close and reopen those tabs at ease without worrying that those references will be lost.

## Obtain the extension

To obtain this extension, go to the page on [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabs-cache-and-management/ecgfkcddifhjofkeagepcffjakglmoog/)

## Disclaimer

Even though this extension asks for permission on reading browsing history, it actually does not read your browsing history. It only stores (on your local computer) the urls that you want to select and store.  It is not trying to spy your browsing history.

All the code is in this github repo, so one can verify that I am not trying to spy anyone.

## Usage

    - Click each individual link to open that individual link in a new tab
    - Click the D button to remove the WHOLE GROUP (watch out it removes the WHOLE GROUP!)
